# Dictionary
Simple and good looking dictionary app that can do definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. 

Please note that PyDictionary will not install with pip. You will need to install Py-Dictionary. It will work the exact same way.

This uses customtkinter for the modern GUI, and Py-Dictionary. You can easily change colors by editing hexidecimal values, but if you are looking to package it into an app you will need to add the colors.json file when using pyinstaller witht the --add data command.
